# erlyberly

erlyberly is a clone of the console program entop, rewritten in java/javafx.  

## Current State

erlyberly currently does not contain all functionality that entop has so isn't a proper replacement.  It is the basis of a development console which I hope will eventually be a UI over the erlang dbg module to run and view traces on a running erlang node.
